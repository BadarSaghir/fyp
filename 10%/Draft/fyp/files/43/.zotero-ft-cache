Lookout uses computer vision to assist people with low vision or blindness get things done faster and more easily. Using your phone’s camera, Lookout makes it easier to get more information about the world around you and do daily tasks more efficiently like sorting mail, putting away groceries, and more.

Built with guidance from the blind and low-vision community, Lookout supports Google’s mission to make the world’s information universally accessible to everyone.

Lookout has five modes for a variety of activities:

• Use Food Labels mode (beta) to quickly identify packaged foods by their label, in addition to scanning barcodes. Available in more than 20 countries.

• Read a whole page of text with Documents mode, now with support for handwriting. Take a photo of a document, and Lookout will scan the text, so that it can be read aloud by your screen reader or magnified on your phone.

• Use Text mode to quickly skim text and hear it read aloud — for doing things like sorting mail.

• Use Currency mode to identify banknotes quickly and reliably, with support for US Dollars, Euros, and Indian Rupees.

• Explore mode (beta) offers information about objects in your surroundings.

Lookout is available in more than 20 languages, and runs on devices with Android 6 and above. Devices with 2GB or more RAM are recommended.

I really liked this app after installing it and using it - if Google adds Urdu language to it and improves the Explore and Food feature, it will be a very good thing -I will highly recommend this app to install

Couldn't start camera, just shows the every first snap when I opened the app. Camera worked when opened history and went back. Still didn't show any data in Explore.

Still it needs to be improved. Provided features are not accurate whatever can be expected from Google. Developer team needs to work hard. Developer team must read the reviews posted by people. So the mission can be succeed and expectations can be fulfilled. In the end of my review I would like to say that the concept is really pretty fine.
