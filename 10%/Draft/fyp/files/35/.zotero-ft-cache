Sullivan + is a visual-aid app provided by TUAT Co., Ltd. to enhance the accessibility of the visually impaired and low vision users and informs users
who need visual aids about information perceived via the smartphone camera.
With only one shot, you can get the help that suits the situation.
AI mode-AI automatically finds the best results that fit the taken photos.
Did you experience difficulty checking the contents of various documents such as mail, magazines, and newspapers?
Text Recognition-Finds a text and tells you by sound. Point the camera on the place you want text recognition.
When you meet a new person, it tells you which person he or she is.
Face Recognition- It recognizes a person photographed with a camera and tells the person's age and gender.
Have you ever wondered what your surroundings look like?
Image Description - Identifies objects around you and creates a sentence that describes the identified scene.
Whenever you are getting ready to go out in the morning, did you have difficulty finding the color of clothes you wanted?
Color Recognition- Supports the single-color mode that tells you the color of the center of the screen and the full-color mode that tells you the color
that occupies a large part of the entire screen.
Do you worry if the lights were on all night?
Light Brightness - The brightness sensor on the front of the smartphone tells you the light brightness. (Only available in smartphones with brightness
sensor)
It also helps those who are uncomfortable due to low vision, not total visual impairment.
Magnifying glass function- Using the zoom function of the camera, it enlarges or reduces an object or text or inverts the color.
