This is a very good application working very nicely in my mobile I just wanted to know how I can train it detect faces because this feature is not working
TUAT Corp. March 9, 2020
Hi~ Shahab Saqib :) Thank you for using Sullivan plus. :) If the face is detected in Face recognition mode, it will notify you by sound or vibration. However, this notification might not work according to the device model due to a problem with Google Play Service itself. If you have any questions, please send us to tuat.inc@gmail.com. Thank you.

The AP should be improve because it lack manyfeatures like we can't read images in other app by sharing and PDF
TUAT Corp. December 9, 2019
Thanks for using Sullivan plus and your opinion :) The function to recognize the images shared from other apps is now available in sullivan plus. We are also agonizing over a pdf reader. But we are sorry that we can not give a definite answer because we can not apply it right now. We will strive hard so that customers can use the app conveniently.
